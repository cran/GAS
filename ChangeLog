	* DESCRIPTION (Version): New version is 0.1.5.
	* "snorm" is now the skew normal distribution
	reparametrized in terms of mean and standard deviation.
	In the previous "snorm" of version 0.1.4 there was also a
	bug in the unmapping function.
	* Bug correction for quantile function and cdf of "norm".
	* Bug correction for static optimization

	* DESCRIPTION (Version): New version is 0.2.0.
	* Third part optimizers which return an unnamed vector of parameres
	can be used. This is for example nloptr.

	* Starting values are now chosen using the same optimizer defined by the user.
	* Solved bug for qdist_Uni().
	* Some numerical underflow problems are now solved.
	* New distribution: Negative Binomial.
	* New distribution: Skellam.
	* New lower bound for degree of freedom is 2.01. Before was 4.0.
	* Additional argument Compute.SE for UniGASFit, MultiGASFit, UniGASRoll, MultiGASRoll.

2017-10-07
  * DESCRIPTION (Version): New version is 0.2.2.
  * Bug in the visualization of uGASSim and mGASSim objects, instead of

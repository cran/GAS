Generalized Autoregressive Score models in R
}
\description{
The GAS package allows to simulate, estimate and forecast using univariate and multivariate Generalized Autoregressive Score (GAS) models (also known as Dynamic Conditional Score (DCS) models), see e.g. Creal et. al. (2013) and Harvey (2013).

Known bugs and limitations:
\itemize{
\item The Multivariate GAS model for N>4 does not report the exact update for the correlation parameters since the jacobian of the hyperspherical coordinate transformation needs to be coded for the case N>4. The jacobian for N>4 is replaced by the identity matrix.

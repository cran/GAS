Generalized Autoregressive Score models in R
}
\description{
The GAS package allows us to simulate, estimate and forecast using univariate and multivariate Generalized
Autoregressive Score (GAS) models (also known as Dynamic Conditional Score (DCS) models),
see e.g., Creal et. al. (2013) and Harvey (2013) and the website \url{www.gasmodel.com}.
A detailed implementation of the package functionalities are reported in Ardia et. al. (2016a,b).

Current limitations:
\itemize{
\item The multivariate GAS model for N>4 does not report the exact update for the
correlation parameters since the Jacobian of the hyperspherical coordinates transformation
needs to be coded for the case N>4. The Jacobian for N>4 is replaced by the identity matrix.
